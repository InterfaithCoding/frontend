This week we are going to be learning some **front end** technologies. Front end development is the development of those elements of a website that the customer sees and interacts with directly. Designing websites has become far more advanced and complicated over the past five years because of the explosion of variety of devices with varying screen sizes and operating systems. 

The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which needs careful planning on the site of the developer.

####HyperText Markup language (HTML)
HyperText Markup language is the backbone of any website development process, it is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 which has new and efficient way of handling elements such as video and audio files.

####Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution.

####JavaScript
JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.

Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.
Work through the challenges below with your pair.
