This week we are going to be learning some **front end** technologies. Front end development is the development of those elements of a website that the customer sees and interacts with directly. Designing websites has become far more advanced and complicated over the past five years because of the explosion of variety of devices with varying screen sizes and operating systems. 

There are three important languages to help us to **structure**, **style** and control the **behaviour** or our website. 

####HyperText Markup language (HTML)
HyperText Markup language is the backbone of any website development process, it is the HTML code that provides an structure of how the website will look. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 which has new and efficient way of handling elements such as video and audio files.

####Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution.

####JavaScript
JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.

####Today's challenge
We are going to build the front-end of our 'Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock' website. The walkthrough is going to be quite basic, introducing you to the key concepts, but it is up to you to customise and design the website however you want. Have fun with it and use the online resources to help you do something you might not know how to.

The first step is to build the **HTML structure** of the website. Now would be a good time to take a look at the [introduction on HTML](https://github.com/InterfaithCoding/frontend/blob/master/html.md) that I have prepared for you.
